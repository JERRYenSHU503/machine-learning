    "# Build a web app to use a Machine Learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will train an ML model on a data set that's out of this world: _UFO sightings over the past century_, sourced from NUFORC's database.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to 'pickle' a trained model\n",
    "- How to use that model in a Flask app\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue our use of notebooks to clean data and train our model, but you can take the process one step further by exploring using a model 'in the wild', so to speak: in a web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you need to build a web app using Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building an app\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to build web apps to consume machine learning models. Your web architecture may influence the way your model is trained. Imagine that you are working in a business where the data science group has trained a model that they want you to use in an app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many questions you need to ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Is it a web app or a mobile app?** If you are building a mobile app or need to use the model in an IoT context, you could use [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/) and use the model in an Android or iOS app.\n",
    "- **Where will the model reside?** In the cloud or locally?\n",
    "- **Offline support.** Does the app have to work offline?\n",
    "- **What technology was used to train the model?** The chosen technology may influence the tooling you need to use.\n",
    "  - **Using TensorFlow.** If you are training a model using TensorFlow, for example, that ecosystem provides the ability to convert a TensorFlow model for use in a web app by using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/).\n",
    "  - **Using PyTorch.** If you are building a model using a library such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), you have the option to export it in [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for use in JavaScript web apps that can use the [Onnx Runtime](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/). This option will be explored in a future section for a Scikit-learn-trained model.\n",
    "  - **Using Lobe.ai or Azure Custom Vision.** If you are using an ML SaaS (Software as a Service) system such as [Lobe.ai](https://lobe.ai/) or [Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) to train a model, this type of software provides ways to export the model for many platforms, including building a bespoke API to be queried in the cloud by your online application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have the opportunity to build an entire Flask web app that would be able to train the model itself in a web browser. This can also be done using TensorFlow.js in a JavaScript context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, since we have been working with Python-based notebooks, let's explore the steps you need to take to export a trained model from such a notebook to a format readable by a Python-built web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, you need two tools: Flask and Pickle, both of which run on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… What's [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)? Defined as a 'micro-framework' by its creators, Flask provides the basic features of web frameworks using Python and a templating engine to build web pages. Take a look at [this Learn module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) to practice building with Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… What's [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)? Pickle ðŸ¥’ is a Python module that serializes and de-serializes a Python object structure. When you 'pickle' a model, you serialize or flatten its structure for use on the web. Be careful: pickle is not intrinsically secure, so be careful if prompted to 'un-pickle' a file. A pickled file has the suffix `.pkl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - clean your data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll use data from 80,000 UFO sightings, gathered by [NUFORC](https://nuforc.org) (The National UFO Reporting Center). This data has some interesting descriptions of UFO sightings, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long example description.** \"A man emerges from a beam of light that shines on a grassy field at night and he runs towards the Texas Instruments parking lot\".\n",
    "- **Short example description.** \"the lights chased us\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ufos.csv` spreadsheet includes columns about the `city`, `state` and `country` where the sighting occurred, the object's `shape` and its `latitude` and `longitude`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a blank `notebook` to continue the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` as you did in the previous section and import the ufos spreadsheet. You can take a look at a sample data set:"
