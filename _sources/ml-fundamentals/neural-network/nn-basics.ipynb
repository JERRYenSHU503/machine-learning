    "\n",
    "### Mathematically speaking\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are universal approximations: with just one hidden layer, they can approximate any continuous function with arbitrary precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not guarantee that you can easily find these optimal parameters of your model!\n",
    "\n",
    "It may require extremely large sample size or computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "- First layer needs the size of your input\n",
    "- Last layer's number of neurons equals the output dimension\n",
    "- Last layer's activation is Linear (regression) or softmax/sigmoid (classification)\n",
    "- Almost always start with the relu activation function - if it is not the last layer"
