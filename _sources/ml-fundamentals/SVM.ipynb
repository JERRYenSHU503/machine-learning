    "\n",
    "- SVM works well with unstructured and semi-structured data like text and images while logistic regression works with already identified independent variables.\n",
    "- SVM is based on geometrical properties of the data while logistic regression is based on statistical approaches.\n",
    "- The risk of overfitting is less in SVM, while logistic regression is vulnerable to overfitting.\n",
    "- LR gives calibrated probabilities that can be interpreted as confidence in a decision.\n",
    "- LR gives us an unconstrained, smooth objective. \n",
    "- LR can be (straightforwardly) used within Bayesian models.\n",
    "- SVMs don’t penalize examples for which the correct decision is made with sufficient confidence. This may be good for generalization.\n",
    "- SVMs have a nice dual form, giving sparse solutions when using the kernel trick (better scalability)\n",

    "- One Advantage of SVR over OLSE linear regression is \n",
    "SVR can minimize overfitting problem.\n",
    "- SVR allows non linear fitting problems as well (based on the kernel trick and the representation of the solution/model in the dual rather than in the primal),\n",

    "## Support Vector Machine Summary\n",
    "We have seen here a brief intuitive introduction to \n",
    "the principals behind support vector machines. \n",
    "These methods are a powerful classification method for a number of reasons:\n",
    "- Their dependence on relatively few support vectors means that they are very compact models, and take up very little memory.\n",
    "- Once the model is trained, the prediction phase is very fast.\n",
    "- Because they are affected only by points near the margin, they work well with high-dimensional data—even data with more dimensions than samples, which is a challenging regime for other algorithms.\n",
    "- Their integration with kernel methods makes them very versatile, able to adapt to many types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SVMs have several disadvantages as well:\n",
    "- The scaling with the number of samples N is $O[N^3]$ at worst, \n",
    "or $O[N^2]$ for efficient implementations. For large numbers of training samples, this computational cost can be prohibitive.\n",
    "- The results are strongly dependent on a suitable choice for the softening parameter $C$. \n",
    "This must be carefully chosen via cross-validation, which can be expensive as datasets grow in size.\n",
    "- The results do not have a direct probabilistic interpretation. This can be estimated via an internal \n",
    "cross-validation (see the ```probability``` parameter of ```SVC```), but this extra estimation is costly.\n",
