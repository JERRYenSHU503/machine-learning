    "## NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a library for working with tensors, i.e. multi-dimensional arrays. Array has values of the same underlying type, and it is simpler than dataframe, but it offers more mathematical operations, and creates less overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The basics of numpy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Data manipulation in Python is nearly synonymous with NumPy array manipulation: even newer tools like **Pandas** are built around the NumPy array. This section will present several examples of using NumPy array manipulation to access data and subarrays, and to split, reshape, and join the arrays. While the types of operations shown here may seem a bit dry and pedantic, they comprise the building blocks of many other examples used throughout the book. Get to know them well!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover a few categories of basic array manipulations here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes of arrays: Determining the size, shape, memory consumption, and data types of arrays.\n",
    "- Indexing of arrays: Getting and setting the value of individual array elements.\n",
    "- Slicing of arrays: Getting and setting smaller subarrays within a larger array.\n",
    "- Reshaping of arrays: Changing the shape of a given array\n",
    "Joining and splitting of arrays: Combining multiple arrays into one, and splitting one array into many.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NumPy array attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's discuss some useful array attributes. We'll start by defining three random arrays, a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional array. We'll use NumPy's random number generator, which we will seed with a set value in order to ensure that the same random arrays are generated each time this code is run:"

When even cell phones have processing speeds measured in Giga-FLOPS (i.e., billions of numerical operations per second), this seems almost absurdly slow. It turns out that the bottleneck here is not the operations themselves, but the type-checking and function dispatches that CPython must do at each cycle of the loop. Each time the reciprocal is computed, Python first examines the object's type and does a dynamic lookup of the correct function to use for that type.

    "#### Aside: big-O notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O notation is a means of describing how the number of operations required for an algorithm scales as the input grows in size.\n",
    "To use it correctly is to dive deeply into the realm of computer science theory, and to carefully distinguish it from the related small-o notation, big-***θ*** notation, big-***Ω*** notation, and probably many mutant hybrids thereof.\n",
    "While these distinctions add precision to statements about algorithmic scaling, outside computer science theory exams and the remarks of pedantic blog commenters, you'll rarely see such distinctions made in practice.\n",
    "Far more common in the data science world is a less rigid use of big-O notation: as a general (if imprecise) description of the scaling of an algorithm.\n",
    "With apologies to theorists and pedants, this is the interpretation we'll use throughout this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O notation, in this loose sense, tells you how much time your algorithm will take as you increase the amount of data.\n",
    "If you have an ***O[N]*** (read \"order *N*\") algorithm that takes 1 second to operate on a list of length *N*=1,000, then you should expect it to take roughly 5 seconds for a list of length *N*=5,000.\n",
    "If you have an ***O[N^2]*** (read \"order *N* squared\") algorithm that takes 1 second for *N*=1000, then you should expect it to take about 25 seconds for *N*=5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the *N* will usually indicate some aspect of the size of the dataset (the number of points, the number of dimensions, etc.). When trying to analyze billions or trillions of samples, the difference between ***O[N]*** and ***O[N^2]*** can be far from trivial!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the big-O notation by itself tells you nothing about the actual wall-clock time of a computation, but only about its scaling as you change *N*.\n",
    "Generally, for example, an ***O[N]*** algorithm is considered to have better scaling than an ***O[N^2]*** algorithm, and for good reason. But for small datasets in particular, the algorithm with better scaling might not be faster.\n",
    "For example, in a given problem an ***O[N^2]*** algorithm might take 0.01 seconds, while a \"better\" ***O[N]*** algorithm might take 1 second.\n",
    "Scale up *N* by a factor of 1,000, though, and the ***O[N]*** algorithm will win out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even this loose version of Big-O notation can be very useful when comparing the performance of algorithms, and we'll use this notation throughout the book when talking about how algorithms scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured data: numPy's structured arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "While often our data can be well represented by a homogeneous array of values, sometimes this is not the case. This section demonstrates the use of NumPy's **structured arrays** and **record arrays**, which provide efficient storage for compound, heterogeneous data.  While the patterns shown here are useful for simple operations, scenarios like this often lend themselves to the use of Pandas `Dataframe`."
