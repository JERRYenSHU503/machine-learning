    "In these sections, you will learn some of the ways that data can be managed, manipulated, and used in applications. You will learn about relational and non-relational databases and how data can be stored in them. You'll learn the fundamentals of working with Python to manage data, and you'll discover some of the many ways that you can work with Python to manage and mine data.\n",

    "This section on structured and record arrays is purposely at the end of this chapter, because it leads so well into the next package we will cover: Pandas. Structured arrays like the ones discussed here are good to know about for certain situations, especially in case you're using NumPy arrays to map onto binary data formats in C, Fortran, or another language. For day-to-day use of structured data, the Pandas package is a much better choice, and we'll dive into a full discussion of it in the chapter that follows.\n",
