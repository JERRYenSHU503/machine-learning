    "Time series forecasting is a broad field with a long history and forcasting is perhaps the most common application in the real world. Businesses forecast product demand, governments forecast economic and population growth, meteorologists forecast the weather. The understanding of things to come is a pressing need across science, government, and industry (not to mention our personal lives!), and practitioners in these fields are increasingly applying machine learning to address this need.\n",

    "- the time period during which you require forecasted values (target).\n",

    "\n",
    "The forecast horizon is the time for which you are making a forecast. We often describe a forecast by the number of time steps in its horizon: a \"1-step\" forecast or \"5-step\" forecast, say. The forecast horizon describes the target.\n",

    "\n",
    "The time between the origin and the horizon is the lead time (or sometimes latency) of the forecast. A forecast's lead time is described by the number of steps from origin to horizon: a \"1-step ahead\" or \"3-step ahead\" forecast, say. In practice, it may be necessary for a forecast to begin multiple steps ahead of the origin because of delays in data acquisition or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing Data for Forecasting\n",
