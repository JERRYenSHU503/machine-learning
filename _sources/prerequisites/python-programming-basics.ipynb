    "## What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- web development (server-side),\n",
    "- software development,\n",
    "- mathematics,\n",
    "- system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Syntax compared to other programming languages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python was designed to for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python indentations\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code."

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is completely object oriented, and not \"statically typed\". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "- A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).\n",

    "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses.
