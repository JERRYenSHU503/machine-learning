    "Linear regression is a fundamental and widely used technique in machine learning and statistics for predicting continuous values based on input variables. It finds its application in various domains, from finance and economics to healthcare and engineering. When using linear regression, it's essential to assess the model's performance accurately. This is where linear regression metrics come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will delve into the world of linear regression metrics, exploring the key evaluation measures that allow us to gauge how well a linear regression model fits the data and makes predictions. These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's accuracy, precision, and ability to capture the underlying relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover essential concepts such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2) score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Understanding these metrics is crucial for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and anyone looking to harness the power of linear regression for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you are building models for price predictions, sales forecasts, or any other regression task, mastering these metrics will empower you to make informed decisions and fine-tune your models for optimal performance. Let's embark on this journey to explore the intricacies of linear regression metrics and enhance our ability to assess and improve regression models."

    "In the realm of linear regression metrics, one fundamental measure of model performance is the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**. MSE serves as a valuable indicator of how well your linear regression model aligns its predictions with the actual data points. This metric quantifies the average of the squared differences between predicted values and observed values."
